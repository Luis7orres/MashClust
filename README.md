# MashClust

Fast bacterial genome dereplication using Mash distances

## Overview
MashClust reduces redundant bacterial genome sets by clustering highly 
similar genomes and selecting representative strains from each cluster.
Useful for pan-genome analysis, comparative genomics, and dataset reduction.

## Features
- Fast k-mer-based distance calculation using Mash
- Greedy clustering with customizable identity thresholds
- Representative genome selection from each cluster
- Typical reduction: 60-90% fewer genomes while preserving diversity
- Interactive HTML visualizations (cluster distributions, networks, statistics)
- Distance-based phylogenetic trees with full genome name preservation
